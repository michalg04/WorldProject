Project 5
Names: Brittani Kealoha and Michal Golovanevsky
The code is located in Brittani's github

1. An event is triggered by a mouse click.

2. When an event is trigger a restaurant should pop up with some surrounding flowers, 
	a Julie should also span from the restaurant 
	and nearby ore blobs should be drawn to the restaurant.

3. The ore blobs should turn into rats if they are in radius of two away from the restaurant
    at the time of the mouse click and eat the cookies that julie has created.
    The rats should move slower and less efficiently than julie so,
    she can create cookies faster than they are eaten.

4. Julies should turn ore into cookie and move faster than miners.
